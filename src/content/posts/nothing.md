Before something appeared, I was there, and after everything disappears, I will still be here. All of the creation begins with me. So does it ends with me. And yet, strange as it is, nobody ever talks about me! It bothers me a lot, because most people chatter about something, always ignoring me! Neglecting the fact that I sustain something and all his fellow-thing-friends. All these somethings would never happen if it were not for me. I guess only the wisest ones were sure of me. They knew nothing mattered more than everything else. So, here goes the story of me—the story of nothing.

You wouldn’t generally talk about me, because you would probably know nothing about me. And also since there’s nothing to talk about, almost impossible to define. Only nothing defines me. A negation, not anything, no single thing, nothing at all - my distant relatives. Now I know, it's strange to read something about me, nothing—a thing which everybody probably hates to do. Nobody likes to sit down and do nothing. All the time you want to do something, talk about something, read something, find something, and be something. But, you should know that I, nothing, matter more than something.

Grab a cup if you can. A cup which you use to drink tea or milk. If you don't have one now, imagine. Now, what are you looking at? Its shape, color, and materials or if you look long enough you will end up appreciating the design patterns it has, if it has any. But you will miss the obvious thing in it that makes it useful for what it is. A cup is useful not for what you can see. It is useful for what you cannot see — all that empty space, the nothing-ness inside it. Without me, it is just a blob of stone. That strange element of nothing-ness in it allows you to use it to its fullness and drink whatever you like drinking. I know this analogy sounds strange, but you see, it applies to everything.

All this life that you are made up of, all these somethings, is happening somewhere, right? You are made up of matter, then molecules, then atoms, then subatomic particles, and then waves, that somehow appear out of nothing, and vanish into nothing. Wipe out the entire universe, you will get me. Pick an atom, almost a hundred percent of it.
